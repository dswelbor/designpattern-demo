# Contributing to DesignPattern Demos
This is a pretty casual project and contributors are always welcome. 
Contributions can come in many forms - whether that's efficiency improvements, 
better documentation, code comment cleanup, or new design pattern examples. In 
the interest of consistency, we do have some guidelines for pull requests.

## Branch Naming Conventions
More to come on this later as the project matures...feel free to contribute here 
as well!!

Note: At this early stage in the project, as long as branch names make sense and are 
relevant to the feature enhancements, this should suffice.

## Workflow
To keep things stable and, we ask the contributions follow a common workflow:
1. Create a new feature branch for contribution branched from `dev`
2. Commit changes, documenting as necessary (try to integrate with what already 
exists)
3. Create a pull request in the following format:
   ```
