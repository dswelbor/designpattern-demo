# Design Patterns
This project aggregates some code I've written to illustrate different design 
patterns. Conceptually understanding design patterns, their applicability, 
and how they work in practice is often better understood when there is tangible 
code that can be referenced to explore implementation details with context.

## Languages
Design Patterns are largely language independant. They promote concepts like 
aggregation over inheritance for code reuse, loose coupling between classes, and 
more. Most of this is language agnostic. However, it's important to recognize 
differences in language features to effectively implement these patterns in 
practice.

To make these examples more relevant, design patterns have been implemented 
in the following languages with plans to support more languages in the future:
- Java
- Python

## Java Design Patterns
The following design patterns have been implemented in Java:
- Adapter
- Decorator
- Iterator


## Python
This section is under construction. More to come at a later date.
